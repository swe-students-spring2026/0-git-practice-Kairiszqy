[AI is already writing almost one-third of new software code, study shows](https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai-software-code.html)

## Interesting Points
I found it fascinating and interesting how rapidly generative AI is being adopted in real-world software development, to the point that almost one‑third of new code in the United States is now being written with AI assistance. This highlights how quickly AI have penetrated daily programming workflows, and how it is shifting the very nature of the craft of coding itself.

Another intriguing aspect is the uneven impact of AI across experience levels and regions. The study shows that while less experienced developers use AI tools more often, the productivity gains are mostly seen among senior developers, suggesting that AI might amplify existing skills rather than level the playing field. 

## Comment from Yutong Liu
What I found most interesting in this article is how quickly AI has become embedded in everyday software development rather than remaining a niche tool. The article suggests that AI changes how code is written, but not who ultimately benefits the most from it, which made me think about the role of experience in software engineering. It reinforces the idea that while AI can assist with coding tasks, understanding systems, requirements, and trade-offs remains essential.
