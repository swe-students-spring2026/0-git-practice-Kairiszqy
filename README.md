## Interesting Points
I found it fascinating how rapidly generative AI is being adopted in real-world software development, to the point that almost one‑third of new code in the United States is now being written with AI assistance. This highlights how quickly AI have penetrated daily programming workflows, and how it is shifting the very nature of the craft of coding itself.

Another intriguing aspect is the uneven impact of AI across experience levels and regions. The study shows that while less experienced developers use AI tools more often, the productivity gains are mostly seen among senior developers, suggesting that AI might amplify existing skills rather than level the playing field.
